🚀 Smart Notification System
📌 Overview

The Smart Notification System is a full-stack, rule-based, event-driven application designed to deliver timely and relevant notifications based on predefined conditions.
Instead of overwhelming users with unnecessary alerts, the system ensures that notifications are triggered only when specific rules are satisfied, improving efficiency, clarity, and response time 🔔⚡

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional notification systems often:

Send excessive and irrelevant alerts

Reduce user attention due to notification overload

Lack intelligent rule-based filtering

This results in delayed actions and poor user experience.

💡 Solution

The Smart Notification System continuously monitors events or inputs, evaluates them using rule-based logic, and triggers notifications only when required conditions are met.
The system follows a modular, event-driven architecture, making it scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

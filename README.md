🚀 Smart Notification System
Overview

The Smart Notification System is a full-stack, rule-based, event-driven application that sends notifications only when predefined conditions are satisfied.
It avoids unnecessary alerts and ensures users receive only relevant and actionable notifications.

Problem

Most notification systems:

Send too many irrelevant alerts

Cause notification fatigue

Do not support rule-based filtering

This reduces attention and delays important actions.

Solution

This system monitors events, evaluates them using rule-based logic, and triggers notifications only when required conditions are met.
The architecture is modular and scalable, making it easy to extend with new rules and notification types.
